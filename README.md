<!-- FAQ -->
## :grey_question: FAQ

- Isn't there two GLONE posts?

  + ...Yeah i know. GLONE and GLONE2 has been mixed up, to result in a better mockery. Plank included, but exclude the appgrid.
This also goes for MockOS*


- Where's that attempt of making Xfce looking like KDE?

  + it sucks. Sometimes when i stare back at it again i just wanna destroy my eyes looking at how terrible it is.

- Xunnity and LXWin?

  + Mixed.
